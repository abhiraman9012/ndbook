# Running Jupyter Notebook with GitHub Actions

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that can be automatically executed via GitHub Actions.

## Workflow Setup

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run the notebook whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch, a pull request is made to the `main` branch, or when manually triggered from the Actions tab.

## Required Secrets

To run the notebook successfully, you need to set up the following secret in your GitHub repository:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key

### How to Add Secrets to Your GitHub Repository

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" 
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Enter the name `GEMINI_API_KEY` and paste your API key as the value
6. Click "Add secret"

## Google Drive Integration

The notebook contains code that interacts with Google Drive. For this to work in GitHub Actions, you'll need to:

1. Store your Google Drive service account credentials as a GitHub secret, or
2. Modify the notebook to skip Google Drive operations when running in GitHub Actions

## Running the Workflow Manually

To run the notebook manually:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select the "Run Jupyter Notebook" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose the branch to run from and click "Run workflow"

## Viewing Results

After the workflow completes, you can download the executed notebook from the "Artifacts" section of the workflow run page.
